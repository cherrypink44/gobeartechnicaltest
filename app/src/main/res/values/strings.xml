    <string name="intro_msg">In a nutshell, GoBear makes it simple for you to compare insurance plans and financial
        products to find the one that’s right for you. We take all the complicated and, let’s face it, boring
        information from banks and insurance providers, make it easy-to-understand and put it on your computer screen,
        tablet or phone in a way that makes it easy for you to compare apples with apples. That’s it. No trick or
        surprises from us. (Except the good kind of surprises. We like those.)
